# Graph-Aware Neural Networks 

Training neural networks capable of modeling power grid topology variations presents a substantial challenge for the application of machine learning in *N-k* contingency analysis and grid reconfiguration. The combinatorial explosion of N-k scenarios with system size results in a computational complexity that exceeds the capabilities of traditional solvers.

This repository contains files used to generate training and testing datasets and sample datasets that can be applied to graph-aware neural network algorithms for the purpose of *N-k* scenario analysis.
